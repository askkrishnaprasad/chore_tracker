- Each **household (home)** has:
  - Its own set of users
  - Its own chore list

### 3. **Chore Sharing & Partial Completion**
- Users can choose to:

## Project Goal

To create a **stylish, intuitive, and fair household chore tracking system** that not only manages responsibilities but makes the process engaging and even fun ‚Äî with **smart visuals**, **interactive features**, and a **dashboard that feels like a productivity app, not a to-do list**.
